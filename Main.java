/** Discussion
 * 1) How did you represent the social network? Why did you choose this representation?
 *
 *    The problem reduced to a shortest path problem, so I chose a graph to represent the social network.
 *    Each node represents a user and an edge between two nodes indicates that the two users are friends.
 *    Since friendship is transitive, the best structure for our social network would be an unweighted, undirected graph.
 *
 * 2) What algorithm did you use to compute the shortest chain of friends?
 * What alternatives did you consider? Why did you choose this algorithm over the alternatives?
 *
 *    The algorithm I used to determine the shortest chain of friends was a bidirectional breadth first search.
 *    This means doing two breadth first searches, one from the first user and one from the second user.
 *    When we have a collision between those two searches, weâ€™ve found a path.
 *    I chose this approach instead of a simple breadth first search because it is faster and it reduces
 *    the amount of nodes we need to visit.
 *    If branching factor of tree is N and distance between two users is M, then the normal breadth first search
 *    complexity would be O(N^M). If we execute two search operations then the complexity would be O(N^{M/2})
 *    for each search and total complexity would be O(N^{M/2}+N^{M/2}) = O(N^{M/2}) which is far less than O(N^M).
 *    I also considered Dijkstra's Algorithm, but the major disadvantage of this algorithm is the fact that it does
 *    a blind search, so it wastes a lot of time processing.
 *
 * 3) Please enumerate the test cases you considered and explain their relevance.
 *
 *     I created a sample graph and I tested the algorithm on different pairs of users to ensure it's correct.
 *     The graph contains cycles, unreachable users, multiple paths to the same user.
 *     These tests do not ensure performance, as the graph is pretty small.
 *     Note: Open graph.png to see the graph, go to line 84 to see the tests
