# Shortest-chain-of-friends

Let's build a social network. 


In this social network, each user has friends.

A chain of friends between two users, user A and user B, is a sequence of users starting with A and ending with B, such that for each user in the chain, ua, the subsequent user, ua + 1, are friends.

Given a social network and two users, user A and user B, write a function that computes the length of the shortest chain of friends between A and B.
